newSingleThreadExecutor() vs newFixedThreadPool(1)
Main difference between the two is the type of queue used. newSingleThreadExecutor() uses an unbounded queue, 
while Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1) uses a fixed-size queue. If the application submits many tasks to the thread pool,
the unbounded queue of newSingleThreadExecutor() can lead to out-of-memory errors, 
while the fixed-size queue of Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1) prevents the number of queued tasks from exceeding a certain limit.
